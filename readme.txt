file navigation to quickly locate the file you want to explore.

The idea is to place a tag_file in each sub_root directory. The
tag_file will document the info of the sub_root in the same root.
The tag_file contains the following five lines(not fixed number):
project:
year:
beamline:
dataid:
participants:

In the GUI, you need to provide the root directory, which holds all
sub_root directoies for your data files. You can provide multiple
root directories, which are seperated by ",".
Then you should also provide the tag_file name

In the query selector, you type in the conditions. You don't have to fill
in all blanks. eg. if you provide the year to 2019, that means you want to
know all the file locations with data collected at 2019.

To launch search action, click search. The results will be shown on the right
side. To click clear, you will erase all the selector contents you typed in.
